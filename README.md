This repository is my submission for completing the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
CodeBook a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R prepares the data and then shows the 5 steps required for the project (see course assignment description for more details):
Merges  training and  test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels  data set with descriptive variable names.
Uses data set from previous step to create a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Data_Final.txt is the  final data after going through all the sequences described above.
